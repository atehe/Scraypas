# Scraypas
---
Folder in this repo represents a webscraping project built mainly with scrapy. Any extra description for setting up the environment for the scrapers will be provided in the projects README and a requirements.txt for installing dependencies.

Generally, the projects are built on scrapy, a fast high-level web crawling and web scraping framework used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages.

## Setup
Scrapy is best installed in a virtual environment, to prevent conflicts with other packages. Conda, venv or pipenv can be used.

**Using Conda**

- Creating Environment 
```
conda create -n scraypa_env
```

- Activating Environment
```
conda activate scraypa_env
```

- Installing scrapy
```
pip install scrapy
```

## Contributions
Contributions can be done by simply by opening a pull request describing what the contribution is for. Issues with any scraper can also be posted and will be reviewed at my earliest convenience.

## Thank You.
