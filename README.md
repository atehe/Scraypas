# Scraypas
Folders in this repo represent a webscraper that crawls a website to extract data in structured format from their pages. More details of the scrapers in their respective README.

#### Completed
- [Jumia](http://jumia.com.ng/) - flashsales
- [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/) - countries population, countries covid data
- [Myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) - Animes

#### Work in Progress
- [Asianwiki](https://asianwiki.com/) - TvN Dramas, SBS Dramas

## Setup
Generally, the projects are built mainly with Scrapy. Scrapy is best installed in a virtual environment to prevent conflicts with other packages, Conda, venv or pipenv can be used. Any extra description for setting up the environment for the scrapers will be provided in the projects README and a requirements.txt for installing dependencies.

**Using Conda**

Creating Environment 
```
conda create -n scraypa_env
```

Activating Environment
```
conda activate scraypa_env
```

Installing scrapy
```
pip install scrapy
```
